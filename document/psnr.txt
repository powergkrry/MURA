There are no psnr function in pytorch.
So I will make my own psnr funtion with inherit Loss function in pytorch.

psnr = -10*log10(MSE / S**2)
S is the maximum pixel value.
I saw someone write a function like psnr = -10*log10(MSE) in github
I will find why people use that way.

In pytorch, torch.nn.MSELoss function has size_average = True.
If it is False, loss is summed for each minibatch.
If it is True, loss is averaged for each minibatch. (so, the loss is per image)

In above blog, they says S is global maximum pixel value.
So, it is 225, but in our code, we divided by 225, so S is 1.
So the psnr = -10*log10(MSE) might be correct.

In the blog, people cannot recognize the difference of the two images if they has more than 30dB of psnr.
So our goal is to make a model that gives image near that psnr.
