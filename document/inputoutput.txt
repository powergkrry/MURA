general input output (state of art)

< objective >

We used gaussian noised images as input, and clean image as output.
But is it effective to do denoising?

< trial >

In simple linear autoencoder code, that network uses clean image as both input and output.

In Natural Image Denoising with Convolutional Networks (2008), they added noise.

In Beyond a Gaussian Denoiser : Residual Learning of Deep CNN for Image Denoising (2017), the added different range of noise (Gaussian).
And they set the patch size as 50x50. (I think this means they cropped images with size 50x50)

< conclusion >

We will use input and output as below.
input : crop image as 1/4  size, add gaussian noise with various sigma
output : crop image as 1/4 size, clean images

We will train the network with input and noise = input-output.

Since we only use convolutions, there are no problem in predicting different size of images.
