general input output (state of art)

< objective >

We used gaussian noised images as input, and clean image as output.
But is it effective to do denoising?

< trial >

In simple linear autoencoder code, that network uses clean image as both input and output.

In Natural Image Denoising with Convolutional Networks (2008), they added noise.

In Beyond a Gaussian Denoiser : Residual Learning of Deep CNN for Image Denoising (2017), the added different range of noise (Gaussian).
And they set the patch size (?) as 50x50.
