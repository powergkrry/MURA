train a model with multi GPU

< objective >

There are two GPUs at server so I wanna use both GPUs in training.


< trial >

autoencoder = AutoEncoder()
autoencoder = torch.nn.DataParallel(autoencoder, device_ids = [0, 1])
autoencoder.cuda()

Second line of the above codes makes the model trained by multi-GPU.

torch.cuda.manual_seed_all(1)

This code is for setting seed for all GPUs.


< conclusion >
